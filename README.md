# Horiseon code refactor project AUG2020

# This is a first crack at refactoring for me.

# The goal for this project is to consolidate some of the CSS and use some semantic HTML to look easier on the eyes and clear up some of the replaceable code with semantic syntax.

# Open this link in any browser and you will open to the updated version of the Horiseon webpage.

# The content has changed too much other than a couple small details with the Head of the page, and the HTML behind has been cleaned up and consolidated to a degree. No major changes have been made, other than the condensing of all the redundant CSS.

# Also you will find in the code I have added notes in the HTML as well as the CSS file to hopefully in the future have faster fixes and and updates as well as letting you the client see what is in the code and how it correlates to your website.
